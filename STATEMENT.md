# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Small to mid-sized hotels often rely on manual ledgers or disconnected spreadsheets to manage guests. This leads to issues such as double-booking, calculation errors in billing, and difficulty in tracking current room occupancy status in real-time. [cite_start]There is a need for a centralized, digital solution to handle these core tasks[cite: 99].

## Scope
The scope of this project is limited to a **Console-Based Application** that handles the lifecycle of a guest's stay. It covers the flow from check-in to check-out. [cite_start]It does not currently support online payments or multi-hotel chain management[cite: 100].

## Target Users
* **Hotel Receptionists:** For checking guests in and out.
* **Hotel Managers:** For viewing current occupancy status.
* [cite_start]**Room Service Staff:** For updating food orders against specific rooms[cite: 102].

## High-Level Features
* **Automated Room Allocation:** Prevents double-booking logic.
* **Billing Engine:** Aggregates room rent and service charges.
* [cite_start]**Data Persistence (Runtime):** Maintains state as long as the application is running[cite: 103].
